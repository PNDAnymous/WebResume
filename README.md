Web Resume
Hi there, this is my personal web resume(Webume?), built with HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript and SVG. It's designed to be clean, minimal, and easy to read, with a black/white theme to keep things practical.

This project is a small but meaningful corner of the internet where I can share my experience, skills, and a bit of my personality. It’s still a work in progress! For instance the “Learn More” page is on the way, and will include some background on my journey, maybe even a headshot (if I feel spicy).

Right now, it's a minimally viable product; simple and functional, but growing.
